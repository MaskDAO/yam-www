        <span>
        MaskDAO is a community led Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built off the success of Hashmask NFTâ€™s. Together the DAO will innovate the NFT ecosystem by building an artist focused marketplace, curate new NFT releases, and new tools proposed by community members. 
        </span>

        <span>
        In order to launch MaskDAO, there will be a MSK governance token distribution phase. Distribution will reward Hashmask owners, and can also be earned through a variety of liquidity mining programs.
